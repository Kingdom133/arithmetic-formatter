Students in primary school often arrange arithmetic problems vertically to make them easier to solve. The arithmetic_arranger function receives a list of strings which are arithmetic problems, and returns the problems arranged vertically and side-by-side. The function optionally takes a second argument. When the second argument is set to True, the answers should be displayed.
The function should return the correct conversion if the supplied problems are properly formatted, otherwise, it will return a string that describes an error that is meaningful to the user.
